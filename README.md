# Challenge NearSure

This project was created using react-native framework in addition with **expo** for setting up a fast development environment. In order to install expo cores command you must run the following command:

    npm install -g expo-cli

In order to run the local dev environment you must be sure to have Node 10+ installed, then just clone the repo and run the following command line:

    npm start

To actually test the repo and view a live demo, you'll need to install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. 


I've also included a short gif of the app running on the Epo client simulator on an Iphone 6s Plus
