# Challenge NearSure
<br>
This project was created using react-native framework in addition with ** expo ** for setting up a fast development environment
<br><br>
In order to run the local dev environment you must be sure to have Node 10+ installed, then just clone the repo and run the following command line:
<br>
    npm start
<br><br>
To actually test the repo and view a live demo, you'll need to install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. 
<br><br>

I've also included a small gif of the app running on the Epo client simulator on an Iphone 6s Plus
